Page 8
---
### 35.(29.)
By [[CRA Audit Response and rationale February 2022.pdf|letter dated February 3, 2022]], [[the CRA auditor]] advised that [[the audit]] of the [[Appellant]]’s claims for [[Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy|CEWS]] in respect of all claims filed for the periods, as listed in [[#Appendix A]], between March 15, 2020 and October 23, 2021 was complete and that, as a result, [[Canada Revenue Agency|CRA]] was proposing to make changes to the [[CEWS Applications]] as outlined in the attached [[#Appendix B]], disallowing all of the [[Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy|CEWS]] amounts claimed by the [[Appellant]]. 

### 36.(30.)
[[the CRA auditor|The CRA auditor]] described [[Canada Revenue Agency|CRA]]’s position with respect to the [[CEWS Applications|CEWS application]] made by the [[Appellant]] as follows:

> To qualify for the [[Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy|CEWS]], an [[entity]] must first be a "[[Qualifying Entity]]" ([[Income Tax Act|125.7(2)]]) which is defined as an "[[Entity Eligibility|eligible entity]]" in [[Income Tax Act|125.7(1)]] as:
> 
> (a)               a [[corporation]] or a [[trust]], other than a [[corporation]] or a [[trust]] that is exempt from tax under this Part or is a [[Public Institution|public institution]];
> 
> (b)               an [[Person|individual]], other than a [[trust]];
> 
> (c)               a [[Registered Charity|registered charity]], other than a [[public institution]];
> 
> (d)               a [[Person|person]] that is exempt from tax under this Part because of paragraph 149(1)(e), (j), (k) or (l), other than a [[Public Institution|public institution]];
> 
> (e)               a partnership, all of the members of which are described in this paragraph or any of paragraphs (a) to (d); or
> 
> (f)                a [[Prescribed Organization|prescribed organization]].
> 
> As the [[Appellant|Organization]] is a [[Registered Charity|registered charity]], it must be determined whether it meets the definition of a [[Public Institution|public institution]] which is contained in subsection [[Income Tax Act|125.7(1)]] as:
> 
> (a)               an organization described in any of paragraphs [[Income Tax Act|149(1)(a) to (d.6)]]; or
> 
> (b)               a [[School|school]], [[Board|school board]], [[hospital]], [[health authority]], [[public university]] or [[college]].
> 
> Based on our review of the pertinent documents relating to the [[Appellant|Organization]] and the information you provided to us during the audit process, it is our view that [[Appellant|Cornerstone Christian School]] Inc. meets the definition of a [[Public Institution|public institution]], as it is part of the [[Prairie South School Division]] #210 that is governed by the Saskatchewan [[Board of Education]].

Our determination is based on the following:
Page 9
---
#### A.
The [[Memorandum of Agreement|agreement]] between [[Appellant|Cornerstone Christian School]] and [[Prairie South School Division|the School Division]] shows that the [[Board of Education]] controls the majority of the [[Operations|Organization's operations]] as the [[School|school]] must follow the [[Saskatchewan accredited curriculum]] and all teaching staff are employees of the [[Board of Education]]. Funding provided to the school is for teachers' salaries, supervision, management and direction of teaching staff, curriculum leadership and support for teaching staff, and professional development opportunities for teaching staff.

#### B.
The [[Memorandum of Agreement|agreement]] further states that the teaching staff are employees of the [[Board of Education]] and governed by all policies, procedures and practices of [[Board of Education|the Board]].

#### C.
The [[Board of Education]] shares the responsibility for recruiting, selecting, and hiring teaching staff for [[Appellant|the Associate School]].

#### D.
With respect to the Associate school [[Operations|operations]], [[Appellant|the school]] agrees to subscribe to the [[Goals of Education for Saskatchewan]] in accordance with [[Departmental Policy F.1.2 -  Accredited Independent Schools - Goals of Education|Departmental Policy F.1.2, "Accredited Independent School: Goals of Education]]. It will to conform to [[provincial curriculum policy]] with respect to required areas of study, common essential learnings, locally determined options; and adaptive dimensions and to provide approved programs and courses of study, in accordance with [[Departmental Policies D.3 - Submitting Programs (Grades 1 to 9) for Approval|Departmental Policies D.3. "Submitting Programs (Grades 1 to 9) for Approval"]] and [[Departmental Policy F.1.3 - Accredited Independent Schools Curriculum and Instruction|F.1.3]].

#### E.
In the event of teacher redundancies the parties agree that in the case of a redundant teacher at [[Appellant|the Associate School]], the teacher could be placed in another school operated by [[Board of Education|the Board]], and in the event of a redundant teacher at another school operated by [[Board of Education|the Board]], the teacher could be placed in [[Appellant|the Associate School]].

The above points A to E, show that [[Appellant|Cornerstone Christian School]] does not have direction and control over its teaching staff and most of its curriculum. [[Appellant|The Associate School]] must follow the [[accredited curriculum of Saskatchewan]] and is limited to [[controlling]] only the religious teachings, support staff, and transportation of the school. The [[majority]] of the school's [[Operations|operations]] revolves around teaching staff and the [[Saskatchewan accredited curriculum]]. The school also doesn't have the authority to act on its own to hire its teaching staff and redundant staff of the school and other schools of the [[Board of Education]] can be moved around within the [[Prairie South School Division]].

In order to receive funding from the [[Board of Education]], [[Appellant|The associate school]] is required to follow the practices and procedures of the [[Prairie South School Division]], use the [[Saskatchewan accredited curriculum]], and allow its teachers to be employees of the [[Board of Education]].
Page 10
---
In conclusion, for the reasons above, [[Appellant|the Organization]] is an [[Entity Eligibility|ineligible entity]] for the purposes of the [[Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy|CEWS]] as it is a [[Public Institution|public institution]]. Accordingly, we are proposing to deny all of the [[Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy|CEWS]] claim amounts for the [[qualifying periods]] pursuant to subsections [[subsection 125.7(1)|125.7(1)]] and [[subsection 125.7(2)|125.7(2)]] of the [[Income Tax Act]].

### 37.(31.)
At no time during the course of the audit did [[the CRA auditor]] address the questions a to whether the [[Appellant]] qualified as an “[[Entity Eligibility|eligible entity]]” pursuant to subsection [[Income Tax Act|125.7(1)(f)]] on the basis that it was a “[[Prescribed Organization|prescribed organization]]” being a [[Person|person]] or partnership that operates a [[Private School|private school]] or private college.  Furthermore, the [[Appellant]] states that [[the CRA auditor]] did not seems to understand that the [[CEWS Applications|CEWS Application]] files by the [[Appellant]] did not involve any teaching staff, but only non-teaching staff employed and paid for by the [[Appellant]].

### 38.(32.)
By [[Notice of Determination]]/Redetermination of the [[Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy|CEWS]] dated March 1, 2022, issued pursuant to [[subsection 152(3.4)]] of [[Income Tax Act|the Act]] in respect of the [[Appellant]]’s [[CEWS Applications]], the [[Minister]] reduced the [[Appellant]]’s [[CEWS Applications]] to the revised amounts as set out in the attached [[#Appendix B]] (the “**[[Redeterminations]]**”). 

### 39.(33.)
By [[Notice of Objection]] dated May 27, 2022, the [[Appellant]] objected to the [[Redeterminations]]. 

### 40.(34.)
By [[Notice of Confirmation]] dated December 1, 2023, the [[Minister]] confirmed the Redetermination stating as follows:

As stated in our [[Proposal Letter|proposal letter dated July 18, 2023]] we base our decision on a review of the facts and documents submitted, and have decided that [[Appellant|Cornerstone]] was not an [[Entity Eligibility|eligible entity]] pursuant to [[subsection 125.7(1)]] of the [[Income Tax Act]], because it was a [[Public Institution|public institution]] and therefore was not eligible to receive the [[Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy|CEWS]] claimed for the periods listed above.

As [[Appellant|Cornerstone]] was part of the [[Prairie South School Division]] #210 which was governed by the Saskatchewan [[Board of Education]], we have determined that [[Appellant|Cornerstone]] was a [[Public Institution|public institution]], as defined in [[subsection 125.7(1)]] of [[Income Tax Act|the Act]].

## **B.        ISSUES TO BE DECIDED**

### 41.(25.)
The [[Appellant]] submits that the issues to be determined in regard to the [[Redeterminations]] can reasonably be described as follows:

The [[Appellant]] further states that as a [[Registered Charity|registered charity]] and in accordance with its [[Articles Of Incorporation|articles of incorporation]] and bylaws, on dissolution the assets of the [[Appellant]] must pass to another Christian education [[Registered Charity|registered charity]]. 

### 56.(40.)
The [[Appellant]] states that it is not a body that acquires its existence and its authority by virtue of a statute enacted by a legislative body and whose functions and transactions benefit and affect the entire community of persons to whom its authority extends, and that it is accountable to its members of the non-profit corporation, and not to members of the public generally.

### 57.(41.)
The [[Appellant]] states that there is no authority that mandates the [[Appellant]]’s existence by virtue of a statute enacted by a legislative body. 

### 58.(42.)
The [[Appellant]], as [[Registered Independent Schools|registered independent school]] an [[Independent Associate School|associate school]], acquired its existence by way of its own private desire to provide educational services that support the Christian religious beliefs.

### 59.(43.)
The [[Appellant]] therefore states that it is an “[[Entity Eligibility|eligible entity]]” within the meaning of definition contained in [[subsection 125.7(1)]] of [[Income Tax Act|the Act]] as it was both a [[Registered Charity|registered charity]], other than a [[Public Institution|public institution]] or [[Public School|public school]], and a “[[Prescribed Organization|prescribed organization]]” being a [[Person|person]] that operates a [[Private School|private school]] within the meaning of [[subsection 8901.1(1)|paragraph 8901.1(1)(f)]] of the _[[Income Tax Regulations]]._ 

## **E.        RELIEF SOUGHT**

### 60.(44.)
The Taxpayer requests that the [[Redeterminations]] issued March 1, 2022, be vacated, varied or referred back to the [[Minister]] on the basis that the [[Appellant]] is entitled to the [[Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy|CEWS]] amount as originally claimed set out in [[#Appendix A]] to this Notice of Appeal, and that the adjustments made to the [[Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy|CEWS]] amount in the [[Redeterminations]], including any arrears interest assessed to the [[Appellant]], be reversed in full.

## **F.         PLACE OF TRIAL**

### 61.(45.)
The [[Appellant]] proposes that the hearing of this appeal be heard at the City of Saskatoon, in the Province of Saskatchewan.

## **G.        NAME AND ADDRESS FOR SERVICE UPON THE APPELLANT**
