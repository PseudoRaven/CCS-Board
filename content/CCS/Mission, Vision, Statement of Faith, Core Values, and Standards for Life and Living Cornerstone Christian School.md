Mission
The mission of Cornerstone Christian School is to provide students with Christ-centered education that they may know, love, and serve God.

Vision
The vision of Cornerstone Christian School is to have Christ-like students effectively using their gifts and callings to glorify God.

Statement of Faith
1. We believe the Bible to be the only inspired, infallible, authoritative, inerrant Word of God.
2. We believe there is only one God, eternally existing in three persons; Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
3. We believe in the deity of Christ, His virgin birth, His sinless life, His miracles, His vicarious and atoning death, His resurrection, His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and His personal return in power and glory.
4. We believe in the absolute necessity of regeneration by the Holy Spirit for salvation because of the exceeding sinfulness of human nature; and that men are justified solely on faith in the shed blood of Christ, and that only by God's grace through faith alone are we saved.
5. We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; they that are saved unto the resurrection of life, and they that are lost unto the resurrection of damnation.
6. We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ.
7. We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a godly life.
